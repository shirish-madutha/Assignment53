    "Gaussian Naive Bayes: This is used when the features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. It assumes that the features are continuous and normally distributed.\n",

For example, if you are working with text data, you might start with Multinomial Naive Bayes, while Gaussian Naive Bayes is more appropriate for continuous numerical data.
